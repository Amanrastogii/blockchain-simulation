# 🔗 Blockchain Simulation Project

A mini project simulating the basic principles of blockchain technology including block linking, mining with Proof-of-Work (PoW), and consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, DPoS).

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `blockchain_simulation.py` – Simulates a basic blockchain with 3 linked blocks and demonstrates how tampering affects chain validity.
- `mining_simulation.py` – Demonstrates Proof-of-Work mining by finding a nonce that satisfies a difficulty condition.
- `consensus_demo.py` – Simulates and compares PoW, PoS, and DPoS consensus mechanisms using mock validators.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries needed (uses `hashlib`, `random`, and `time`)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-sim.git
cd blockchain-sim

# Run each simulation file
python blockchain_simulation.py
python mining_simulation.py
python consensus_demo.py
